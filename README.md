# Font Awesome for TYPO3

TYPO3 CMS Extension "iconpack_fontawesome"


## What does it do?

This Extension registers an Iconpack-Provider for EXT:iconpack which allows you to use the [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com) in TYPO3.

The following versions are included in this extension, and can be selected via the TYPO3 backend:
- *5.14.4-free*
- *6.7.2-free*
- *7.1.0-free*


## Installation/Configuration

1. Install EXT:iconpack from TER/git or with composer
2. Install this Extension from TER/git or with composer
3. Customize configuration (Optional)


## Upgrade

If you are currently using version 6 and would like to switch to version 7, simply change the version in
*Settings > Extension Configuration > Configure extensions...* and switch the version to be used to "FontAwesome 7.x.x.".

> **Note**
> Please note that all icons previously used in version 6 can be displayed in version 7, and that translation occurs automatically
> during rendering. No data in the database is changed in the process. Only when you add new icons or change existing ones will new
> icons with the identifier “fa7” be created. These are then no longer backward compatible, so I advise against a subsequent
> downgrade if you have already created icons with the new version.
